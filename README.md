# Diabetic-Retinopaty-Detection
This project focuses on using image processing techniques to analyze retinal images and detect anomalies indicative of the disease. It is designed to detect Microaneurysms in the images.
# Key Functions
1.	Loads a diabetic retinopathy image
2.	Converts the image to grayscale
3.	Applies median filtering to reduce noise
4.	Applies thresholding to segment the blood vessels
5.	Applies morphological operations to enhance the blood vessels
6.	Find the optic disc using a function
7.	Draws a circle around the optic disc
8.	Calculates the area of the optic disc
9.	Calculates the number of microaneurysms
10.	Displays the results
